# MVP-Project

We would like to create an internal task management application for ABC, Inc. 
Our users will need to create, read, update, and delete tasks. 
You should assume that all users have the same role and permissions.

• All communications with the backend service should be done via REST API endpoints with JSON payloads in the response
• All data will need to be persisted to fulfill the requirement
• The codebase should contain a basic test suite to confirm functionality
• The candidate should include a script to generate test data
• A user should only have access to tasks that they have created
